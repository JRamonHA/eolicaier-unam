## Academic Training
### [Bachelor of Engineering in Renewable Energy](https://www.ier.unam.mx/licenciatura.html)
<div class="texto">
  <p>The Bachelor of Engineering in Renewable Energy (LIER) is a multidisciplinary degree that arises as a response to the great energy challenges and global environmental problems, which demand professionals who meet the needs of the energy sector and sustainable development, with social responsibility. This degree is carried out in collaboration with the UNAM Institute of Engineering (II-UNAM). It lasts 4 years and its curriculum is executed every semester. Specialists in the areas of photothermal systems, photovoltaic systems, materials design, refrigeration systems and heat pumps, geothermal energy, wind energy, biofuels, fuel cells, energy in buildings, energy planning, energy sustainability and environmental impact participate. In addition to this infrastructure of human resources, II-UNAM also has a solid academic staff with experience and recognition in the areas of photothermal systems, hydraulics, ocean energy, energy in buildings and biofuels.</p>
